"Man, this level looks pretty big..."

[RareRoamingStrings]
"Do these pants make my ass look big?"
"These pants work wonders for my ass cleavage."

[FragStrings]
"Eat that! Mmm... eat..."
"Could've used a little salt."
"Tastes like chicken!"
"Oh yeah! Easy as pie!"
"Piece of cake!"
"Like taking candy from a baby!"
"I'll take fries with that!"

[KilledStrings]
"I'll never get out of this place!"
"I really need to get in shape."
"Ugh, I had too much pizza last night..."
"Hmm, maybe I shouldn't have had those three cheeseburgers before fighting."
"That's it, tofu and salad from now on!"
"Damn, that hurt!"
"Nothing a couple twinkies won't fix!"

[RoamingStrings]
"I wonder what Crash's doing tonight..."
"Do you think Crash would go out with me?"
"Crash... she's pretty..."
"Man, I wish this level was smaller so I didn't have to run so much."
"All this running around is making me hungry."
"Man, I haven't seen my feet in SO long."
"Hey, you guys wanna go get something to eat after this?"
"All this running... it's like gym class all over again!!"
"Man, this suit is chafing my legs."
"Having man boobies sucks."

[LosingRoamingStrings]
"Man, I'm losing! Must be all the saturated fat..."
"This is really wearing me out!"
"I'm exhausted!"
"I need a pick-me-up! Now where did I put my Snickers bar..."
"Man, my back really hurts. I need to start wearing a girdle."

[EnragedStrings]
"Dammit, I will crush you!"
"Stop it, or I will EAT YOUR CHILDREN!!!"

[DemoralizedStrings]
"Oh man... I didn't think I was this bad..."

[WinStrings]
"Wow, I won! Burgers on the house!"
"Alright! What do you say we order a pizza?"
"I won! This is sweet... like CANDY!"
"Now that's what I call 'well-done'!"

[LoseStrings]
"I better hit the treadmill! But first... DOUGHNUTS!"
