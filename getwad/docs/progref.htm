<center><h2>GetWAD</h2><br>
<b>Programmer's Reference</b><br>
<b>Version 2.1<br>
December 7, 2003</b></center>

<h4>1. Description</h4>
<p>

The GetWAD library consists of a single DLL file which depends
on standard Windows libraries as well as the WININET library.
This means that GetWAD is compatible with any 32-bit version
of Windows (Win95 and later) provided that Internet Explorer
(4.0 or later) is installed. The DLL is multi-threaded and can
be called from either single- or multi-threaded programs (or 
DLLs), but it must not be called <b>concurrently</b> from multiple
threads of the same program (ie., it's not reentrant); this
should not matter for the intended use. It should be able to
be used from practically any language that supports DLLs.

<p>
<h4>2. Interface</h4>
<p>

The library interface is minimal in order to facilitate its
use from various programs. The interface consists of two
groups of two functions each; each application using the
library should select one of these groups.
<ol>
<li> <b>The version 1.x API</b>: it uses a built-in search
     list and does not contact the GetWAD master servers.
     <p>
	<ul>
	<li> The "<b>getwad_setup()</b>" function presents a dialog
	     that lets the user specify various searching parameters,
	     such as the pages to be searched for the WADs, enabling /
	     disabling of the FTP protocol and the directory where it
	     will deposit the WADs. This function should be rarely
	     used, as the program defaults to some reasonable values.
	     The various search parameters are stored in an INI file
	     and they are used from the next function. This also means
	     that a client program can generate the INI file using its
	     own dialogs, so it may not have to call this function at
	     all.
	<li> The "<b>getwad_fetch()</b>" function does the actual work
	     of locating, downloading and unzipping the WAD files. It
	     reads the parameters stored in the INI file by the previous
	     function and tries to locate the desired file. Once the
	     file is located, it is downloaded, unzipped (since all
	     WADs are stored inside ZIP files) and copied to the
	     appropriate directory.
	</ul>
<p>	
<li> <b>The version 2.x API</b>: it contacts the GetWAD master
     servers to obtain the current search list at the beginning
     of each search. 
     <p>
	<ul>
	<li> The "<b>getwad2_setup()</b>" function is completely
		analogous to the getwad_setup() function of the 1.x API,
		but instead of defining the search pages, it defines
		a set of user-defined pages which will be used in addition
		to the ones downloaded from the master server.
	<li> The "<b>getwad2_fetch()</b>" function is analogous to
		to the getwad_fetch() function of the 1.x API; the
		difference is that it contacts the GetWAD master servers
		in order to obtain the current search list. It also
		accepts an extra URL to search; this is convenient as
		many server admins provide a page with pointers to WADs
		played on their servers.
	</ul>

</ol>
The 1.x API exists only for compatibility purposes with
software interfacing to the older version of GetWAD; the version
2.x API is vastly more convenient for the end users, so it should be
preferred.

<table border=0 cellpadding=5 width=100% >
<tr bgcolor=#90dFFF><td colspan=2>
<b>void WINAPI	getwad_setup(HWND hwnd, BOOL allow_dest_spec,
			LPSTR ini_name,LPSTR ini_section);</b>			
</td></tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td><b>Purpose:</b></td>
<td>Presents a configuration dialog. The user can select
which pages and search engines it should consult,
whether to enable the FTP protocol or not,
and where to deposit the downloaded WAD files.
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign=top>
<td><b>Parameters:</b></td>
<td>
<b>hwnd</b>: Handle to a window in the calling application.
The configuration dialog will be a child of the specified window.
It can be zero but it is strongly discouraged, as the user will then
be able to switch to the calling application before closing the
configuration dialog.
<p>
<b>allow_dest_spec</b>: Boolean flag indicating if we want to allow
the user to select the destination directory. If set to "TRUE" (ie.,
any integer value different from zero), the user will be able to
select the WAD destination directory. If set to "FALSE" (ie., zero),
the WAD destination directory will not be displayed. This can be useful
since Doom launchers normally provide for a means to specify the WAD
directory. 
<p>
<b>ini_name</b>: Specifies the INI file to be used for storing the
configuration parameters. If it is NULL or empty, GetWAD uses the
default file "getwad.ini". If you don't specify any path component,
the file is assumed to be in the WINDOWS directory. If this is not
true, you must specify the full pathname of the INI file.
<p>
<b>ini_section</b>: Specifies the section inside the INI file that
will be used for storing the configuration parameters. If it is NULL
or empty, GetWAD uses the default section "Options".

			BOOL dont_wait_upon_success,
			LPSTR ini_name, LPSTR ini_section);
</b>			
</td></tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td><b>Purpose:</b></td>
<td>
Locates, downloads and installs the specified WAD file.
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign=top>
<td><b>Parameters:</b></td>
<td>
<b>hwnd</b>: Handle to a window in the calling application.
The function will display a dialog indicating the progress
of the downloading process. That dialog will be a child of
the specified window. It can be zero but it is strongly
discouraged, as the user will then be able to switch to
the calling application before returning from this function.
<p>
<b>wadnames</b>: Names of the WAD files to be fetched; it
consists of one or more names of WAD files separated by one
or more spaces. Each name may have a ".wad" or ".zip" extension,
but it is not necessary. If for example you want to download the
file "brit11.wad", then you could set wadnames either to "brit11.wad",
"brit11.zip", or "brit11". If you want to fetch the files "exec.wad"
and "dweller2.wad", you could set wadnames to "exec dweller2", or 
"exec.wad dweller2.wad", etc. If this parameter is NULL or empty,
GetWAD will prompt the user for the WAD to fetch.
<p>
<b>waddir</b>: Name of the directory where you want to deposit
the downloaded WAD. This parameter takes precedence over the
parameter specified in the GetWAD INI file. This can be convenient
when you don't want to bother calling "getwad_setup()" or 
constructing the INI file; in that case, you can simply pass
the destination directory here; the default GetWAD values will
normally be sufficient for the rest of the configuration. If
waddir is NULL or empty, then GetWAD will use the value specified
in the INI file.
<p>
<b>dont_wait_upon_sucess</b>: Boolean flag indicating if GetWAD
should close the dialog automatically when the requested file
is successfully installed. If set the "TRUE" (ie., any integer
value different from zero), GetWAD will close its dialog automatically
and will return to the caller. If set to "FALSE" (ie., a value
of zero), GetWAD will wait until the user presses the "Close"
button.
<p>
<b>ini_name</b>: Specifies the INI file to be used for storing the
configuration parameters. If it is NULL or empty, GetWAD uses the
default file "getwad.ini". If you don't specify any path component,
the file is assumed to be in the WINDOWS directory. If this is not
true, you must specify the full pathname of the INI file.
<p>
<b>ini_section</b>: Specifies the section inside the INI file that
will be used for storing the configuration parameters. If it is NULL
or empty, GetWAD uses the default section "Options".
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign=top>
<td><b>Return&nbsp;value:</b></td>
<td>
Returns 1 upon success, 0 upon failure (ie., the files cannot be
located or the network is down, or whatever), or -1 if the INI
file has not been properly created (you can avoid using the INI
file, <b>if</b> you specify the WAD directory; otherwise, the
INI file must exist and it must contain a WAD directory specification).

<b>server_search</b>: Specifies an extra search page that will be
used after the user-specified pages and before the ones fetched
from the master servers. It will be ignored if it is NULL or empty.
This parameter can be convenient, as server administrators often
set up pages containing links to WADs played on their servers.

<h4>4. INI File Format</h4>
<p>
As mentioneed above, GetWAD uses an INI file to store its configuration.
The INI file name defaults to "getwad.ini" and the section inside the
INI file defaults to "Options", but both can be modified by the calling
program. There are cases where the calling program may prefer to use its own
configuration dialog rather than the one provided by "getwad_setup()". In
that case, the calling program will probably want to construct the
INI file on its own instead of relying on the default GetWAD options. For
this reason, we describe here the format of the INI file. Such a sample file
looks like:
<p>
<table align=center bgcolor=#ffefd0 cellpadding=10 border=0>
<tr><td><pre>[Options]
use_google=1
enable_ftp=1
wad_dir=C:\INETDOOM\wads
npredef=5
predef000=http://www.freewebs.com/lap-clan/
predef001=http://www.getsomewhere.net/?dep=doom&pg=files
predef002=http://raider.dnsalias.com:8000/doom/wads/
predef003=http://www.rarefiles.com/download/
predef004=http://www.doomsearch.com/search.shtml?search=%s
</pre>
</td></tr></table>
<p>
The various parameters correspond to the options in the Setup dialog. 
The "npredef" and "predefNNN" parameters are used only by the 1.x
API: "npredef" is the number of the predefined locations that will
be searched by the program, and "predefNNN" are the URLs of these
locations. Make sure that the number of such locations is correctly
indicated by the "npredef" parameter.
