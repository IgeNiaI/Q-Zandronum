<center><h2>GetWAD</h2><br>
<b>Version 2.1<br>
December 7, 2003</b></center>


<h4>1. Description</h4>
<p>

GetWAD is a library and a sample program to locate, download,
unpack and install WAD files automatically. Its primary purpose
is to simplify the WAD handling for Doom players.
<p>

On a first level, the sample program (getwad.exe) can be used by
end users to fetch the desired WADs. Even though this is not perfectly
automatic (the user has to specify the WAD name), it is still the
easiest way that I know to find and install WADs.
<p>

On a second and more important level, the library (getwad.dll) can
be used directly by other Doom-related programs (eg., launchers)
to automate the procedure even more (eg., they would simply ask
for permission to find the file and the user would not have to
specify anything else). For this reason, the DLL interface is
fully documented; any interested developer can download the
developer's documentation and source code of the program from the
<a target=_blank href="http://getwad.keystone.gr/">GetWAD home page</a>. I've tried
to simplify the usage of the library from the main application's
perspective; as far as I can tell, it should be almost trivial to
embed the library in any Doom-related program.
<p>

<h4>2. Usage</h4>
<p>

The sample program can be invoked in two ways:
<ul>
<li> The "<b>Setup</b>" mode: it displays a configuration dialog
     where you can modify the various searching parameters (eg.,
     which pages and search engines it should consult, where to
     deposit the WAD files, etc.). <b>You have to use this mode
     first in order to specify the location of the WAD directory</b>;
     ideally, you will not have to use it after that. You can enter 
     this mode by clicking on the "GetWAD Setup" entry in the GetWad
     program group.
     <p>
<li> The "<b>Search</b>" mode: it simply asks for the name
     of the WAD file (with or without the .wad extension),
     searches for it on the Web, downloads it, unpacks it and
     installs it in the WAD directory. You enter this mode
     by clicking on the "GetWAD" entry in the GetWAD program group.
	<p>
	Another way to invoke the search mode would be to run the program
	from the command line using the following syntax:
	<center>
	<pre>getwad [-d "wad_directory"] wad_name_1 [wad_name_2 ...]</pre>
	</center>
	The "-d" option specifies the directory where the WAD files will be
	deposited, and "wad_name_1", "wad_name_2", etc. specify the desired
	WAD files. This mode can be useful when GetWAD is called from another
	program or script.
</ul>
<p>

<h4>3. Other Characteristics</h4>
<p>

<ul>
<li> It can use the HTTP and FTP protocols.
<li> The program uses the passive mode of the FTP protocol; you can
     optionally disable FTP for some special cases (eg., if you are
     behind a misconfigured firewall).
<li> The program works fine behind properly configured firewalls.
<li> The program obeys the HTTP proxy settings specified in the
     Internet Explorer options.
<li> You can specify up to 100 pages containing links to WAD files;
     these pages will be searched first.
<li> At the beginning of a search, the program contacts one of the
     "master" GetWAD servers to obtain an updated search list of
     URLs to be searched for WAD files; this eliminates any maintainance
     required by the end users, as the master search list will get
     updated as the various web pages change. There are currently 2
     such servers in operation for redundancy purposes (one at
     getwad.keystone.gr and another at zdaemon.org). If for
     some reason the program cannot contact any of them, it uses
     the last search list that has been downloaded; if no such list
     has ever been downloaded, it uses a built-in list (which will
     probably get outdated as time goes by).
<li> The program enforces a network timeout of 60 seconds; that is,
     if a file transfer has stopped for more than 60 seconds, then it
     is assumed dead and the program will cancel it and keep searching.
<li> The program should work on any 32-bit version of Windows provided
     that you have Internet Explorer 4.0 (or later) installed.
<li> The specification of a search page may contain the special sequence
     <b>%s</b> which will be replaced by the name of the file being
     searched. This is useful for specifying search engine URLs. A
     consequence of this capability is that you have to be careful with
     the percent (<b>%</b>) signs; if the URL actually contains a percent
     character (which is rather unlikely), you have to specify it twice
     (i.e., use <b>%%</b> rather than <b>%</b>).
</ul>

<h4>4. Release History</h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Version 2.1 (December 7, 2003)</b>: Bug fixing.
<li> <b>Version 2.0 (December 3, 2003)</b>: Automatic fetching of search
     list from master server, searching enhancements.
<li> <b>Version 1.5 (September 18, 2003)</b>: Google searching improvements.
<li> <b>Version 1.4 (August 26, 2003)</b>: Bug fixing.
<li> <b>Version 1.3 (August 24, 2003)</b>: Fixed a problem with one
     of the predefined search pages (SUNet changed its address lately),
     and added support for a command line version of the program under
     Unix (it has been tested under Linux, but it's not very system-specific:
     it should work on other Unices as well).
<li> <b>Version 1.2 (August 2, 2003)</b>: Extended the command line
     syntax to simplify the interface to other programs and allow the
     fetching of multiple wad files with a single call.

     program.

I would also like to offer a big thank you to Eugene Bondarchenko (aka Bond, the 
creator of IDE) for precious help in improving and testing the program.
<p>
Finally, I am indebted to the kind folks who set up and maintain the various
link pages and search engines that provide easy access to the
WAD files and other net resources. The default link pages
searched by GetWAD are the ones administered by
